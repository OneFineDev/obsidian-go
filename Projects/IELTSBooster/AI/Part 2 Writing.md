| 0    | Does not attempt the task; provides a completely unrelated or illegible response.                                             | Writing is so incoherent that it is impossible to assess.                                                                      | Uses no recognizable vocabulary; writing is essentially a collection of unconnected words.                                       | Demonstrates virtually no control of grammar and punctuation; errors are pervasive and make communication impossible.              |

Answer (delimited by === ):

===
In the modern world, many cities are full of cars, factories and etc., which are running on gas. Hence, a lot of countries are having huge problems with their environment, with polluting their land, water and atmosphere. In this essay, I will examine the impact this has had on many countries and suggest how this problem can be solved.

The foremost issue with poisoning surroundings, such as air and water infection with traffic fumes and garbage, thrown in rivers and seas. This could lead to global catastrophe, because the air and water would be full of deadly viruses and garbage, that could result in infecting many people with new lethal diseases. For example, India has the dirtiest river in the world, that is called Gang. Many people wash themselves and drinking the water from the stream, while it is filling up with human and industrial waste, turning into a toxic body of water. The most common illnesses, that people are dying because, are diphtheria and cholera.

A possible solution to this problem is to switch to natural energy use, such as sun energy, electricity and etc. We could remove transport that runs on gas, with electric ones. Also, we can build solar energy producers to produce energy for cities and villages. For instance, in Us there is a lot of cities, that use sun energy panels to generate electricity. But many countries can’t afford this, because they don’t have enough money to buy developed technologies.

In conclusion, with growth of pollute emitters, our world can turn into the lifeless place. To avoid that, all countries should start reducing the rubbish on the streets, filtering the air and clean the water in rivers and lakes.
