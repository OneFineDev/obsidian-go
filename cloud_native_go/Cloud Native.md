- Scalability
	- Vertical
	- Horizontal (State management is key)

- Loose Coupling
	- Avoid distributed monoliths

- Resilience 
	- Design for failure
	- The ability to recover from or handle failure
	- Not = reliability (ability to function as expected for a given time)

- Manageability
	- Alter system behaviour without changing the code

- Observability 
	- Logs, metrics, tracing
